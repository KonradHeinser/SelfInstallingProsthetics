        If you use this be VERY careful about your prefixes. 
        If adding your mod's hediffs to this, try to have the prefix end with an underscore to help
        Ideally, the prefixes have more than a few letters to avoid accidentally catching implants from other mods, but sometimes that is not possible-->

    <SelfInstallingProsthetic_DescriptionAddition>This version of the prosthetic will install itself instead of requiring a surgeon. Installation will attempt to purge existing organic material while retaining existing prosthetics. Removing the part will damage the self installing function, requiring it be installed through surgery in the future.</SelfInstallingProsthetic_DescriptionAddition>
